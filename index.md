# Hello !! ðŸ‘‹
 
## ðŸ”µðŸ”µAbout my memeðŸ”µðŸ”µ 

*The following is meme I made with R software package[{magick}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html)*

1. I fell in love with Stitch because I watched cartoons when I was a child. I liked his funnyðŸ˜œ and felt very happy to see himðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—.
2. I usually chat with my friends and often use meme to better express my emotions.
3. I found three different pictures of stitch to express the sad, love and angry mood.
4. I use the R code to make the my new meme.
